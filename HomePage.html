<h1>-----------------------Introduction to The Internet----------------------</h1>





<h2>Internet</h2>

<p>The Internet is a worldwide network of computer networks that connects university, government, commercial, and other computers in over 150 countries.
There are thousands of networks, tens of thousands of computers, and millions of users on the Internet with the numbers expanding daily. Using the Internet, you can send electronic mail, chat with colleagues around the world, and obtain information on a wide variety of subjects.</p>



<h2>Binary</h2>


<p><b>Binary</b> is a base-2 number system invented by Gottfried Leibniz that's made up of only two numbers: 0 and 1</p>




<h2>Fibre Optic Network</h2>

<p>A wireless network is a great backup solution in case your fiber optic Internet goes down. The two can, and should, complement each other, providing the speed and reliability of fiber, with the mobility of wireless. It also has utility for rural locations where it is prohibitively expensive to run fiber.</p>


<h2>Bandwidth</h2>

<p>Bandwidth is the data transfer capacity of a computer network in bits per second (Bps). The term may also be used colloquially to indicate a person's capacity for tasks or deep thoughts at a point in time.</p>



<h2>Analog</h2>

<p>An analog computer or analogue computer is a type of computer that uses the continuously changeable aspects of physical phenomena such as electrical, mechanical, or hydraulic quantities to model the problem being solved.</p>


<h2>I.P</h2>

<p>An IP address is a unique address that identifies a device on the internet or a local network. IP stands for "Internet Protocol," which is the set of rules governing the format of data sent via the internet or local network.</p>




<h2>DNS</h2>

<p>The domain name system (DNS) connects URLs with their IP address. With DNS, it's possible to type words instead of a string of numbers into a browser, allowing people to search for websites and send emails using familiar names.
</p>



<h2>Digital</h2>

<p>Digital describes electronic technology that generates, stores, and processes data in terms of two states: positive and non-positive.</p>







<h2>I.P Address</h2>

<p>An IP address is a unique address that identifies a device on the internet or a local network. The internet needs a way to differentiate between different computers, routers, and websites. IP addresses provide a way of doing so and form an essential part of how the internet works.</p>




<h2>Bits</h2>

<p>A bit is a binary digit, the smallest increment of data on a computer. Because bits are so small, you rarely work with information one bit at a time.</p>



<h2>Analog</h2>

<p>An analog computer or analogue computer is a type of computer that uses the continuously changeable aspects of physical phenomena such as electrical, mechanical, or hydraulic quantities to model the problem being solved.</p>
