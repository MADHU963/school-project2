<h1>Web Browsing and HTML</h1>


<h2>Broswer</h2>
<p>Browser, software that allows a computer user to find and view information on the Internet. Web browsers interpret the HTML tags in downloaded documents and format the displayed data according to a set of standard style rules.</p>


<h2>Web Server</h2>
<p>Definition: A web server is a computer that runs websites. It's a computer program that distributes web pages as they are requisitioned. The basic objective of the web server is to store, process and deliver web pages to the users. This intercommunication is done using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).</p>


<h2>HTTP</h2>
<p>HTTP is a generic and stateless protocol which can be used for other purposes as well using extensions of its request methods, error codes, and headers.</p>


<h2>HTTPS, SSL, TLS</h2>
<p>Transport Layer Security (TLS) is the successor protocol to SSL. TLS is an improved version of SSL. It works in much the same way as the SSL, using encryption to protect the transfer of data and information. The two terms are often used interchangeably in the industry although SSL is still widely used.</p>


<h2>GET Request</h2>
<p>GET. GET is used to retrieve and request data from a specified resource in a server. GET is one of the most popular HTTP request techniques. In simple words, the GET method is used to retrieve whatever information is identified by the Request-URL. Read more about GET.</p>


<h2>POST Request</h2>
<p>POST is used for changing something. Essentially GET is used to retrieve remote data, and POST is used to insert/update remote data.</p>


<h2>HTML</h2>
<p>HTML, in full hypertext markup language, a formatting system for displaying material retrieved over the Internet. Each retrieval unit is known as a Web page (from World Wide Web), and such pages frequently contain hypertext links that allow related pages to be retrieved.</p>
