<h1>Packets and Routing</h1>

<h2>Protocol<h2>
  <p>Network routing is the process of selecting a path across one or more networks. The principles of routing can apply to any type of network, from telephone networks to public transportation. In packet-switching networks, such as the Internet, routing selects the paths for Internet Protocol (IP) packets to travel from their origin to their destination. </p>


<h2>Packets</h2>
<p>A packet is a small amount of data sent over a network, such as a LAN or the Internet. Similar to a real-life package, each packet includes a source and destination as well as the content (or data) being transferred. When the packets reach their destination, they are reassembled into a single file or other contiguous block of data.</p>


<h2>Router</h2>
<p>Routers guide and direct network data, using packets that contain various kinds of dataâ€”such as files, communications, and simple transmissions like web interactions.</p>


<h2>Fault Tolerant</h2>
<p>Fault tolerance is the property that enables a system to continue operating properly in the event of the failure of (or one or more faults within) some of its components.</p>


<h2>Transmission Control Protocol</h2>
<p>The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is one of the main protocols of the Internet protocol suite. It originated in the initial network implementation in which it complemented the Internet Protocol (IP).</p>


<h2>Scalable</h2>
<p>Scalable hardware or software can expand to support increasing workloads. This capability allows computer equipment and software programs to grow over time, rather than needing to be replaced.</p>
